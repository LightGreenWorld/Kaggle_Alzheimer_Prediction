I first divided the given dataset into Nominal Categorical(17) and Continuous Numerical(14) to analyze them with heatmap.
However, after the contest was over, I got different insight from another participant's code.
He only considered **float64** data (called as Numerical).
The Histplot showed that his choice was right.

For the aspect of Machine Learning Algorithms, I tried to find a suitable method among several options.
However, my code was very basic level without any tuning of hyperparameters.
I was struggling to apply gridSearchCV, though.

I will be trying to develop more to improve performance although the contest was over.
